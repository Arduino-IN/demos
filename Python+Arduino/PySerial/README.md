Using Python to Do More with Your Arduino
==========================================

This folder contains the code to read and write serial data between the computer and the Arduino. 


Code structure
--------------

The same Arduino code has two modes that let you switch between read and write.

There are two separate python scripts for reading from Arduino (pythonread) and for writing to Arduino (pythonwrite)

Hardware
--------

A Micro, and a switch were used in this demo to switch between modes.
