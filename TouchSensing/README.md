Capacitive Touch and Proximity sensing
=======================================

This repository contains the code examples used for the demo on 8th August 2014, @ Arduino Karkhana .


Code structure
--------------

The Arduino-Code directory contains code for two demos :

daftpunk contains the code for the paper console that can be used with touch, the capacitive sensor library for Arduino, and an Arduino Leonardo. 

proximity contains the code for using the MPR121 capacitive breakout board with Arduino to detect proximity of human touch to the object and light up LEDs accordingly. 

Hardware
--------

- daftpunk : Arduino Leonardo, paper-foil console, web browser
- proximity : Arduino Micro, MOSFETs, LED strips, MPR121 breakout board
